		<h1>Focus</h1>
		<p><i>If you haven’t already completed the Introductory tasks, please go back and do so. Please complete the survey and introduce yourself on the Discussion Forum Introductions channel.</i></p>

		<p>We begin this course by asking you to completely reimagine what you think education is. To do this, please watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U" target="_blank">Changing Education Paradigms</a> before you complete any other task. In this video Ken Robinson explains how our modern understanding of education as schooling developed.</p>

		<p>Following this we ask you to reflect on the purpose of education within an Islamic worldview. We use ‘two beginnings’, a) the Qur’anic narrative of Adam alayhi salam being taught the names (al-Baqarah: 29-38) and b) the Qur’anic narrative of the revelation of Qur’an (al-’Alaq: 1-5). We use these verses to explore what it means to be human and to learn and thereby begin to think about education as development and growth in ourselves and in our relationship with Allah. We also look briefly at the relationship between language, speech and learning in these verses, as well as the dialogic dimensions of these narratives. We argue that these are foundational Islamic ideas about education and therefore apply to all forms of education not just ‘Islamic Studies’.</p>

		<p>Please note that in this course, we will not be giving you ready made answers. Rather, we will expect you to engage with questions and think through their implications for your classrooms and your contexts. By sharing your thoughts and ideas with others in the discussion forum, you will begin to develop your own ideas about ‘Dialogue in Islamic Education’, about what that means for your classroom and what changes you may want to make.</p>

		<p>Please download and use the Reflective Journal template for this week to record your thoughts as you read the materials, watch the videos and complete the other activities. This will help you develop your knowledge and understanding.</p>
