		<h2>Weekly Topics</h2>

		<p>At the top of the screen, you will find a link to each of the 6 weeks. You can also access the next week’s materials through the navigation bar at the top of the page. Each week has 5 sections:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>an introduction to the week and what to expect;</li>
			<li>a ‘Focus’ section, which offers video sessions regarding the week’s thematic focus;</li>
			<li>a ‘Read’ section, which will have relevant readings and other resources for that week’s focus area;</li>
			<li>a ‘Do’ section, which will have activities to help support your learning for the week;</li>
			<li>a ‘Discuss’ section, which will instruct you what to contribute to the forum for that week.</li>
			<li>a ‘Reflective Journal’ template to keep notes in and record your reflections so that you can draw on them to complete your final ‘Reflective Report’.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2><a href="#DISQUS" target="_blank">Discussion Forum</a></h2>
		<p>This <a href="#DISQUS" target="_blank">forum</a> was built for you to discuss the weekly course materials, activities and for you to engage with one another about your experiences and challenges. There will be a different channel for each week. There will also be three other channels: (1) an introductions channel for you to post an introduction to yourself, (2) a general channel for you to put any general comments or questions that might not fit within just one week’s channel, and where we will post any course updates.</p>
