		<h1>Focus</h1>
		<p>Having considered the nature, purposes and aims of education in Week 1 and the roles and relationships of educators and learners in Week 2, we now begin to explore shakhsiyah Islamiyah or Islamic personhood as the ultimate goal of education from an Islamic worldview. We begin to tease out the implications of this paradigm shift in how we understand education.</p>

		<p>This week we introduce you to some very challenging ideas and concepts that have major implications for how we think about education. We briefly begin to explore what it means to be human, the uniqueness of each human being and the dialogic nature of our existence. These are incredibly complex and deep topics that have a huge intellectual and practical heritage in the Islamic scholarly tradition. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, our schools, mastabas and madrasahs are not currently drawing on this heritage to develop appropriate educational structures, pedagogy and curricula. This is a huge task, but one that every Islamic educator can be part of.</p>

		<p>We appreciate that the ideas presented this week will lead to many questions. We hope that this course creates dialogue around these ideas, and a community that will build on these ideas together. Use this week’s Reflective Journal to record your reflections as you work through this week’s materials.</p>
