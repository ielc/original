		<h1><u>Focus</u></h1>
		<p>This week we consider the dialogic nature of the educator-learner relationship that is at the heart of Islamic educational practice. Having recognised the centrality of knowledge to our ‘being’ as humans, and to our relationship with Allah azzawajal, our creator; we now turn to look at how the duty to think, to learn, to know and to act shapes our practice as educators.</p>

		<p>Why are we educating? Why these particular learners? What are we educating them for? What are our obligations to them? What are their obligations to us? In what ways  do we engage them in learning? In what ways do we interact with them?</p>

		<p>At the heart of Islamic educational theory and practice is the educator-learner relationship. <i>Suhba</i> (keeping companionship) with one’s teachers has been a core practice for every <i>talib-ul-’ilm</i> (seeker of knowledge/student). Imam al-Ghazali reportedly said, ‘Valueless is the Muslim who is neither a teacher or a student’. We explore the implications of the Islamic duty of lifelong learning for teachers as professionals. If we are always learning, what does that mean for us as teachers? How does the duty to be always learning affect our relationships with our students? How does it affect our relationship with our own teachers past and present? How does it affect our pedagogical approaches?</p>

		<p>This week we begin to explore these complex and fundamental questions, through considering teachers and students as ‘Two Learners’. Use this week’s Reflective Journal to record your reflections as you work through this week’s materials.</p>
